# Sentiment Analysis Model for Online Retail Platforms

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can identify and analyze customer sentiment on products available on different online retail platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay. The model will use natural language processing techniques to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Senti_Anyls_2024.git
```

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

### Data Collection

The first step in this project is to collect data from different online platforms. You can use web scraping techniques to collect customer reviews for different products. Once you have collected the data, you can save it in a CSV file.

### Data Preprocessing

The next step is to preprocess the data. This includes removing stop words, stemming, and lemmatization. You can use the NLTK library for this purpose.

### Feature Extraction

After preprocessing the data, you need to extract features from the text. You can use the bag-of-words model to represent the text as a vector of word counts.

### Model Training

Finally, you can train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data. You can use algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines for this purpose. 

### Model Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can also use techniques such as cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to develop a sentiment analysis model for online retail platforms using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer sentiment, businesses can gain insights into customer preferences and make data-driven decisions.
